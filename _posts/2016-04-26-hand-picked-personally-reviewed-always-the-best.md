Hand picked. Personally reviewed. Always the best.

We Love That Place exists to help you find some of the most interesting, unique and luxurious accommodation on this wonderful tropical island. We know the people who design, run and care for some of the best places in the world. From owner to chef, must do's and must see's, we give you our hand picked selection and they are always reviewed by us personally.

Sri Lanka has so much to offer; from sun drenched beaches, jungle safaris, white water rafting and spiritual temples. We've opened up our 'little black book', so you can find the perfect place to stay. Perhaps a private villa by the beach, a luxury hotel surrounded by wildlife, or a beautiful boutique hotel, they are all here and we've been to experience them ourselves.
